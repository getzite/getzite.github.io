# Zite

I'm going to start to build the product for my startup here.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Bootstrap
MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node.js)

Build a Single Page Application for the actual application

Host on a $5 DigitalOcean linux droplet

Do I want to go with a MEVN stack? Or is a MEAN stack better?

BUSINESS PLAN

I need to come up with an actual business plan, not just have an idea and roll with it. 
How do I want to grow?
What will I use money for if I'm given venture capital?
How will Zeit expand?

Think about these things as I make a MVP.

How do I see my future with Zeit? 

Luckily, since it's SaaS there's very little monetary upfront.
The only thing I'll have to pay for will be the domain and the backend. However, I should make much more than that with the subscriptions.

Also, see if I can use any of my connections through either mom or dad to find someone who could invest or help me go public.

Look into getting some sort of free logo that I can use commercially. Or maybe I can just make a logo myself? Think on this.


Do I actually need fontawesome? How many people are going to want to follow me on Instagram? It should go the other direction, using the social media to get people to go to my site, not driving people from my site to social media.

I'll just include some tiny links at the bottom of the site that will bring people there. Don't push it at all.

Use some nice javascript libraries, but don't go overboard. I still want the website to be fast as possible.

Think about using particles.js for the landing page. I want it to be cool and all, but not too much. Also, ease of use is the most important factor, hands down.

Think about using Gatsby.js for my website. Would this be worthwile?

BRANDING PLAN

The company is being called Zite.

Think about what ways I can market. I need to go to the places where the businesses are. Some are on Instagram, some are on Twitter.
